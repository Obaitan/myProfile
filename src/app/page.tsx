        My career began in the world of precision and creativity as a 2D/3D CAD
        technician and graphic artist—where design thinking, attention to
        detail, and visual storytelling were my everyday tools. A chance
        encounter with the Python programming language opened the door to
        software engineering, sparking a passion that has since evolved into a
        full-fledged front-end development career.

        Today, I merge my design background with modern development skills to
        craft intuitive, visually engaging, and high-performing digital
        experiences. I have had the privilege of contributing to impactful
        projects for both local and international startups, learning from
        diverse teams and pushing creative boundaries.

        Most proudly, I am a co-founder of m30—a SaaS platform redefining
        affiliate marketing in Africa and setting sights on the global stage.
